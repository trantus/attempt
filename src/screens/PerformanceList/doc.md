# Performance Comparison

This document illustrates the difference in performance between two different list implementations.

## Bad Performance (`bad.gif`)

In the **bad** example, you can observe stuttering and low frame rates when scrolling through the list. Items may re-render frequently, and the UI feels sluggish:

![Bad Performance](./bad.gif)

## Good Performance (`/good.gif`)

In the **good** example, the list implementation has been optimized. Notice the smoother scrolling experience and fewer dropped frames, resulting in a more responsive and fluid user interface:
